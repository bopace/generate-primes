# generate-primes
Python implementation of [Fermat's primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_primality_test) to generate prime numbers of any bit length.

## Use
```python
generate_big_prime(n)
# Generates a random prime number of length n bits
```

## Warning
The primes generated by this algorithm are not safe for cryptographic use.
